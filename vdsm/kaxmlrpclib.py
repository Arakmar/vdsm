"""xmlrpclib with a keep-alive transport.

Throws a timeout exception to the client when the underlying
TCP transport is broken.

Inspired by Volodymyr Orlenko,
http://blog.bjola.ca/2007/08/using-timeout-with-xmlrpclib.html

Sets up an xmlrpc Server with a modified Transport
(TcpkeepTransport) which uses a (slightly modified) HTTP
protocol (TcpkeepHTTP) that uses TcpkeepHTTPConnection when it
needs to set up a connection.
