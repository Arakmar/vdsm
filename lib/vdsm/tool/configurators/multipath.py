    # With iSCSI, multipath uses this value to change the iSCSI session
    # timeout, which is 120 seconds by default.
    #
    # With FC, multipath sets the sysfs fast_io_fail_tmo value for the
    # remote ports associated with the path devices.  Multipath sets
    # this value whenever a device is reloaded (e.g. when a new path is
    # added or removed). This will override any change made in
    # /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-*/fast_io_fail_tmo.

    # For FC this is setting the sysfs dev_loss_tmo value for

    # Usage:
    #
    # - Set this if you want failed devices to be removed from the system.
    # - Do not set this is you want failed devices to stay around, since
    #   after they are removed, they need to be rediscovered to get them
    #   back.
    # - Do not set this if the root file system is multipathed. In this
    #   case you want to set dev_loss_tmo to "infinity".  If you don't,
    #   then if all the path devices for your root file system disappear,
    #   udev will not be able to run to send the event to multipath to
