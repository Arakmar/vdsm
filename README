         VDSM: Virtual Desktop Server Manager
         ====================================

The VDSM service exposes an XML-RPC API for managing virtualization
hosts running the KVM hypervisor technology. VDSM manages and monitors
the host's storage, memory and networks as well as virtual machine
creation, other host administration tasks, statistics gathering, and
log collection.

VDSM service originated as a service to be used by a RHEV Manager to
control RHEV Hypervisors and Red Hat Enterprise Linux hosts. It is
now independent of RHEV, usable by any management application and
is intended to be portable to any Linux host providing the KVM
virtualization technology.

Installation
============

The VDSM service can be used by following the standard autotools
installation process, documented in the INSTALL file. As a quick
start you can do

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc \
        --localstatedir=/var --libdir=/usr/lib
   make
   sudo make install

Before starting the VDSM service in the first time, you must configure libvirt

   vdsm-tool libvirt-configure

Packaging
=========

The 'vdsm.spec' file demonstrates how to distribute VDSM as an RPM
package.
